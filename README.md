*this plugin is under active development*

This is a WordPress plugin I am working on building for myself and others. More details will be added to this readme file as I continue building out the plugin.

With DocuPress, you can easily create your own online help documents directly on your WordPress site.

Separate your documentation into collections, making it easy to give users the ability to browse only the content they're looking for.

DocuPress also comes with a custom widget that lets you display your recent documentation articles, randomize the output order and also choose which collection you'd like to display, making it easy to have widgets display recent article links for each collection type.
