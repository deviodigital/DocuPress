Documentation Simplified.

== Description ==

Create your own online help documents from your WordPress dashboard with DocuPress.

Separate your documentation into collections, making it easy to give users the ability to browse only the content they're looking for.

DocuPress also comes with 2 custom widgets:

* Collections - output's a list of every collection you create with DocuPress.
* Recent Articles - select how many articles to display, randomize the output order and also choose which collection you'd like to display articles from.

== Installation ==

1. Go to `Plugins - Add New` in your WordPress admin panel and search for "DocuPress"
2. Install and activate the plugin directly in your admin panel
3. Pat yourself on the back for a job well done :)

== Screenshots ==
